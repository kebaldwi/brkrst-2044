This is Common Deployment Scenario (CDS) # 3 from the Cisco Live presentation BRKRST-2044 - Enterprise Multi-Homed Internet Edge Architectures. CDS-3 highlights the dual router, dual ISP connections deployment example. Within this page are the steps to properly configure BGP Active / Active routing connectivity to the Internet (INET).  There are three option we are going to cover:

- Option 1 - Firewall and FHRP (Section 1)
- Option 2 - ECMP on Firewall (Section 2)
- Option 3 - Intermediate ECMP on L3 Switch (Section 3)

NOTE: For all the Common Deployment Scenarios (CDS) you can load the initial configurations for BB1, BB2, ISP-A, and ISP-B once. We are not making a lot of changes to these devices, if any.
