This is Common Deployment Scenario (CDS) # 4 from the Cisco Live presentation BRKRST-2044 - Enterprise Multi-Homed Internet Edge Architectures. CDS-4 highlights the multiple routers, multiple ISP connections, and multiple sites deployment example. Within this page are the steps to properly configure BGP Active / Active routing connectivity to the Internet (INET). We are going to handle IPv4 and IPv6 separately here, so they will be discussed in their own sections.

NOTE: For all the Common Deployment Scenarios (CDS) you can load the initial configurations for BB1, BB2, ISP-A, and ISP-B once. We are not making a lot of changes to these devices, if any.
